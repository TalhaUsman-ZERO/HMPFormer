# HMPFormer: Hierarchical vision transformer with multi-perspective feature learning for precise polyp segmentation

## 🔍 Highlights
- **Proposes HMPFormer for accurate polyp segmentation in endoscopic images.
- **Introduces MPFL with dynamic, deformable, and static convolutions.
- **Employs CSCF for adaptive cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement.
- **Uses HCAM with reverse refinement to enhance overlooked polyp regions.
